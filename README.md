Dynamic webpage that scrapes and displays Vassar College's schedule of classes with course descriptions

The python script parser.py creates a MySQL database of classes by scraping course information from the Vassar Schedule of Classes page. Course descriptions are extracted from the Course Catalogue and then added into the database at the appropriate course entry. 

PHP is used to interface with the database while the bootstrap framework is used to style and provide functionality to the webpage.
